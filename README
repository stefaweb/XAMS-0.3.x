1) Introduction
================
XAMS (eXtended Account Management System) is - at this time - a software
which is able to manage e-mail accounts for several domains and sites.
It interfaces with the Exim MTA from Philip Hazel and the Courier Mail Server
Suite from Sam Varshavchik. Combining XAMS with them results in a
super flexible, versatile and easy-to-maintain Mail Server Account Managing
Solution for Providers dealing with many domains and resellers per domain.

In its current state Exim is used for SMTP processing, Courier for POP3/IMAP
and XAMS as an interface handling the e-mail accounts of all domains, resellers
and users your e-mail server is responsible for.

The main advantage of XAMS is, that it's managing ALL your mail-accounts in
a MySQL database, therefore it doesn't need and doesn't modify your local
(/etc/passwd) user database to work.

2) Licensing
=============
This software is OSI Certified Open Source Software. OSI Certified is a
certification mark of the Open Source Initiative.

This software is freely distributable under the GNU public license, a
copy of which you should have received with this software (in a file
called Copyright). There are no restrictions for use, private or commercial.

XAMS is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

3) Installation
================
Before you start with the installation and configuration process, you
have to copy autogen.conf.orig to autogen.conf and edit the options to
suit your needs (defaults should be okay in most cases).

After that run ./autogen.sh which will generate several important files
from their templates (for example the installation documentation).

Look at the directories and files in ./docs/install. If you're 
using a Linux distribution which is not described in ./docs/install
try the Debian documentation and please send us the changes that you
need to do for your preferred distribution.

If you're upgrading from an older XAMS release, don't forget to apply
database update from the "updates" directory.

Step by step:

     - Rename autogen.conf.orig to autogen.conf
     - Configure autogen.conf (be careful to do not insert space at line end)
     - Execute ./autogen.sh

4) Log-in
==========
To login into XAMS as an admin use 'adm_' as prefix to your login name
e.g. adm_admin:admin to login in as the default admin-user admin:admin
Resellers have 'res_' as prefix. Customers and users have no prefix.

5) Updating
============
If you want to update XAMS from a previous version - check the updates
directory for further information.
