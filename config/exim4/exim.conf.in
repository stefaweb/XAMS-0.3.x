  # The following section of the ACL is concerned with local parts that contain
  # @ or % or ! or / or | or dots in unusual places.
  #
  # The characters other than dots are rarely found in genuine local parts, but
  # are often tried by people looking to circumvent relaying restrictions.
  # Therefore, although they are valid in local parts, these rules lock them
  # out, as a precaution.
  #
  # Empty components (two dots in a row) are not valid in RFC 2822, but Exim
  # allows them because they have been encountered. (Consider local parts
  # constructed as "firstinitial.secondinitial.familyname" when applied to
  # someone like me, who has no second initial.) However, a local part starting
  # with a dot or containing /../ can cause trouble if it is used as part of a
  # file name (e.g. for a mailing list). This is also true for local parts that
  # contain slashes. A pipe symbol can also be troublesome if the local part is
  # incorporated unthinkingly into a shell command line.
  #
  # Two different rules are used. The first one is stricter, and is applied to
  # messages that are addressed to one of the local domains handled by this
  # host. It blocks local parts that begin with a dot or contain @ % ! / or |.
  # If you have local accounts that include these characters, you will have to
  # modify this rule.

  # allows your own users to send outgoing messages to sites that use slashes
  # and vertical bars in their local parts. It blocks local parts that begin
  # with a dot, slash, or vertical bar, but allows these characters within the
  # local part. However, the sequence /../ is barred. The use of @ % and ! is
  # blocked, as before. The motivation here is to prevent your users (or

# particular group instead of using the sticky bit. The commented options below

# This transport is used for handling pipe deliveries generated by alias or

# to the sender of the message as a delivery error. Set return_fail_output
# instead of return_output if you want this to happen only when the pipe fails
# to complete normally. You can set different transports for aliases and
# forwards if you want to - see the references to address_pipe in the routers
# section above.
