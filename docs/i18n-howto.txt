Creating and maintaining of a XAMS i18n language package
---------------------------------------------------------

This little how-to describes how to create and maintain an own i18n
(internationalization) package for XAMS.
The language packages are encoded with UTF-8 and saved in UNIX line-
break format, so an UTF-8/UNIX capable editor would be very nice.
Maybe it would be more easy to you if you download an existing additional
language package (as the German one) and compare the differences from the
English and the other one.

Send language packages to oliver.siegmar@xams.org - I'll check them,
correct them (if needed) and pack them for later release.


Creating a new i18n package
----------------------------

Standard i18n
--------------

The standard packages (as well as the additional installed ones) are stored
in gui/i18n. Just copy the English package to a new directory with the
name of your language-package (for e.g. 'cp -a english german' if you want
to write a german language-package).
In your new gui/i18n/german directory you have several xml files and another
directory called 'help' with several xml file in it, too.
The standard i18n-files are handled differently from the help files, but
you'll see this isn't difficult to understand.
But before you start with translating you should update the headers in the
xml files. Every i18n file begins (after xml and Doc-type declaration) as
follows:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE i18n SYSTEM "../../include/dtd/i18n.dtd">
<i18n xams-release="0.0.9" file-release="0.0.9" file-revision="1" date="2002-12-29">
    <lngspec name="english" iso="en" localname="english"/>
    <maintainers>
        <maintainer>
            <name>XAMS Core-Team</name>
            <email>info@xams.org</email>
        </maintainer>
    </maintainers>

The first thing you have to change is the i18n-tag. The xams-release is
the version your i18n-package is for. The file-release and file-revision shows
which structure the xml file has to have - if we change this structure someday
you'll see that in the english-package and may have to update yours according
to the structure changes.
The date (ISO - YYYY-MM-DD) shows when your file has been last updated.

After that you have to update the lngspec tag. The name is the english name
for your language (as well it is your directory name). The iso-code is the
two-letter lowercase name of your language defined by ISO 639 (see
i18n-iso639.txt for your language code). The last field - localname - is
used for your language written in your own language - for german this would
be 'deutsch'.

Finally you have to update the maintainers block. If there are more
maintainers for your language package, just add a maintainer block for each
of them. Change the 'XAMS Core-Team' into yours (first-name last-name) and
paste your email-address over 'info@xams.org'.

That's it - just copy this new block to all your i18n files.

Now you can start with translation. There is one title tag and several
msg tags in each i18n file. Just like this (from user.xml):

    <msgs>
        <title id="User Management" />
        <msg id="Account Settings" />

You must never change the id, this is for detecting a i18n-string. Do
it this way (for a german-package):

    <msgs>
        <title id="User Management">Benutzer Verwaltung</title>
        <msg id="Account Settings">Konten Einstellungen</msg>

This is the way all translations has to be done. If a translation
is missing, XAMS will fall back to english (for that sentence).


Help files
-----------

The help files are handled in a different way because they contain large
blocks of text and not simply text-lines. Let's have a look at the header:

<help title="User Management" xams-release="0.0.9" file-release="0.0.9" file-revision="1" date="2003-01-10">
    <lngspec name="english" iso="en" localname="english"/>
    <skindir>{{skindir}}</skindir>
    <maintainers>
        <maintainer>
            <name>XAMS Core-Team</name>
            <email>info@xams.org</email>
        </maintainer>
    </maintainers>

The title attribute of the help tag is the document-title in your language.
The attributes xams-release, file-release, file-revision and date has the same
meaning as described above for the standard i18n files.
The lngspec and the maintainers block is quite the same as in the standard
i18n files, too. The skindir tag has to be kept as it is.
Any help files has a information-block and usually several section blocks. The
information block describes the menu (or whatever this help-file is for) in
general. The sections explains the items in the menu. Each section has a head
tag and a description. Everything (information, head, description) has to be
fully translated.


Maintaining an existing language package
-----------------------------------------

Actually you have to do a 'diff' over the old and the new english i18n-files
and look what has changed. Then update your language package according to that
changes.
