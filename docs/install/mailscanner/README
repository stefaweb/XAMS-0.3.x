How-To install MailScanner on a XAMS-managed Mail-server
---------------------------------------------------------

The XAMS-Development-Team suggests using MailScanner (www.mailscanner.info)
with XAMS for all the Anti-Spam and Anti-Virus stuff. There are several
similar software packages out there which may could be used with XAMS, but
we do only support MailScanner officially, right now.

When it comes to security, you should always ensure to have the most recent
version of anti-virus software installed. 

If you use Debian implementation of Mailscanner, please read documentation in 
/usr/share/doc/mailscanner/README.exim4. All stuff needed to run XAMS and
Mailscanner are incorporated with the Debian Mailscanner package. You don't
need to follow XAMS/Exim adaptations described below.

Mailscanner redady to go package exist for most of the Linux distribution. 

For Debian Linux, use "apt-get install mailscanner".

XAMS/Exim installation
----------------------

Edit the /etc/default/exim4 and apply the following changes:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUEUERUNNER='separate'
# how often should we run the queue
QUEUEINTERVAL='30m'
# more options for the daemon/process running the queue (applies to the one
# started in /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/exim4, too.
QUEUERUNNEROPTIONS='-DOUTGOING'
# options for daemon listening on port 25
SMTPLISTENEROPTIONS='-odq'
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit /etc/xams/exim-custom.conf and comment out the following line:

MAILSCANNER_MODULE = On

If you're using Mailscanner, VIRUS_MODULE and SPAMASSASSIN_MODULE needed 
to be commented (not used).

You will find in contrib/mailscanner/ a Mailscanner plugin named SQLSpamSettingsXAMS.pm.

Place it in /etc/MailScanner/CustomFunctions/ and edit it to configure the database access.

Next edit /etc/MailScanner/MailScanner.conf file according to your needs.
