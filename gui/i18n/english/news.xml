        Welcome to the XAMS News-System. Unfortunately you don't use
        the online version from the XAMS web site. You can go to the Preference 
        menu to activate the Online News system.

    <news author="Stephane Leclerc" subject="XAMS News-System" date="">
        In large installations you may use this system for internal news. In
        this case edit the news.xml and keep it up to date for your users.
        Otherwise you should enable the online news in the preferences.
