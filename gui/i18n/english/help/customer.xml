    <information>
        A Reseller (resp. Administrator) assigns any desired sites 
        to a Customer. These sites then can be administrated by the Customer.
        Here, he has to keep to the limitations given by the Reseller (resp.
        Administrator). He may apply - according to the limits - any desired
        users or aliases and also manage them.
        In contrast to the Reseller, he cannot gain access to the users or
        aliases belonging to another Customer of course.

            Using this option, an Administrator or a Reseller
            can lock a Customer. Thereby he can't login the XAMS
            GUI anymore.

            Here, the Customer is assigned to a specific Reseller.
            Depending on the Reseller, the Site-selection changes
            to the pool that this Reseller administrates.
