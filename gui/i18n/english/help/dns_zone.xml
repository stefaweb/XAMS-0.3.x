    <information>
        The DNS-Management of XAMS allows you to comfortable administrate
        your Domain server. You should already know something about DNS and
        howto configure a BIND nameserver, because we cannot fully explain every
        setting.
        We have added some examples like the Zone "xams.org", to show you what
        it supposed to be entered at each setting.

        <head>Zone Type</head>
        <description>
            To setup a zone, a nameserver must know which type the zone has,
            and who is responsible for that zone.
            Setting it to "Master" (= primary DNS), makes your nameserver responsible
            for the zone. "Slave" makes your nameserver get the zone information off
            another (primary/Master) DNS.
            Setting it to "Dummy", has no effect for your DNS because this zone
            wont be exported by the zone-file generation script.

        <head>Zone</head>
        <description>
            A Zone is a kind of a container for a namespace - a part of a domain
            or subdomain. If your Nameserver manages the zone "xams.org" it also
            manages all subdomains of "xams.org" like e.g. "www.xams.org" or "demo.xams.org".
            The zone "xams.org" can be seen as a subdomain of the zone "org", which is managed
            by a domain-registrar.

        <head>Primary DNS</head>
        <description>
            This field must contain the primary (Master) Nameserver for the given Zone.
            Note that this entry needs a trailing dot, in case it is not a part 
            of the zone itself. In case of "xams.org" it is "sitixns.de.".

        <head>Zone Admin (eMail)</head>
        <description>
            The email-adress of the responsible administrator for the zone
            must be entered here. Note, that instead of the "@"-sign you must
            use a dot. Like with the primary DNS also the trailing dot
            ist needed, when the domain of the email-address isn't a part of the zone.
            The email-address "hostmaster@sitixns.de" would look like "hostmaster.sitixns.de.".
            Note: you cannot use email addresses that have dot within their local part (before
            the "@" sign).

    <section>
        <head>Serial</head>
        <description>
            Every zone needs a unique serial. The most important thing here is
            that the number increases with every change to the zone, so that the
            secondary DNS figure out that something has changed.
            It is common use to take the current date and add a 2 digit serial. e.g.
            2002072101 stands for Year 2002, Month Juli, Day 21st the 01st entry/change
            on that day.

        <head>Automatic</head>
        <description>
            Normally it ist not useful to edit the serialnumber by hand, xams can do this for you.
            There're only few reasons why this feature should be deactivated.

        <head>Time to Live (TTL)</head>
        <description>
            Time-To-Live (TTL) sets how long a client is allowed to cache the informations
            of your zone. A low value has the advantage, that changes get active very fast,
            the disadvantage ist that your nameserver gets asked more often. A meaningful value is
            usually one day.
        </description>
    </section>
    <section>
        <head>Refresh</head>
        <description>
            This value sets the interval the secondary (slave) nameserver uses to actualize
            the Zone. A meaningful value is usually three hours.
        </description>
    </section>
    <section>
        <head>Retry</head>
        <description>
            If the secondary (slave) nameserver doesn't succeed in refreshing the zone
            information, then this value sets the time the server waits until he retries.
            A meaningful value is usually one hour.
        </description>
    </section>
    <section>
        <head>Expire</head>
        <description>
            If a secondary (slave) nameserver cannot actualize a zone, it declares the zone
            invalid after the amount of time set here. It answers no requests for that zone
            after that time.
            A meaningful value is usually one week.
        </description>

    <section>
        <head>Negative TTL</head>
        <description>
            Zone data requested by clients that does not exist, is temporary (for time set here)
            stored as failure. After that time the server tries to resolve the data again.
            A meaningful value is usually one day.
