    <information>
        An Administrator assigns any desired sites definitely to
        one Reseller. These sites then can be just administrated by this special Reseller.
        Here, he has to keep to the limitations given by the Administrator. He may
        apply - according to the limits - any desired Customers and also manage
        them.
        In contrast to the Administrator, he cannot take up changes to the
        system settings, to the field-configuration in the addressbook and
        it is not possible for him to analyse the database.
        In addition to that he cannot gain access to the customers belonging
        to another Reseller of course.

        <description>
            This is the Name of the Reseller as it is e.g. shown
            in the Event-Log. At login this name has to be prefixed by
            "res_", so that XAMS knows wich kind of user it has to
            validate.

        <head>Max. Users</head>
        <description>
            This value defines, how high a reseller can set the User-Limit
            on Site-Level.
            Example: A Reseller has a limit of 20 Users, so he can set
            the User-Limit of one Site to 5 and of another Site to
            15. So, the sum of all User-Limits on Site-Level can not exceed
            this limit.
            This value does only affects the maximum amount of Reseller's
            Users indirect.
