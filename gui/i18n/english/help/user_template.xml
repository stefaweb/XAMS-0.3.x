    <information>
        The user is simplified expressed by the part standing in an e-mail address
        before the @-character. Presently, a user means for XAMS nothing else
        than an e-mail account.
        A user who wants to send and/or receive mails via mail client (MUA) has to
        specify as user name his entire e-mail address.
        It is to be annotated that a user has as many e-mail addresses as domains
        are located in the same site. (for example: the site "firm_name" contains
        the domains "firm_name.com" and "firm_name.net" as well as user "foo" and
        "bar". Both of the users have thereby two e-mail accounts: "foo@firm_name.com",
        "foo@firm_name.net" as well as "bar@firm_name.com" and "bar@firm_name.net".

        <head>Password</head>
        <description>
            With this password the user can receive and send his mails.
            Besides, he can - if permitted by the XAMS configuration - change his
            password as soon as he is logged in to XAMS.

        <head>Quota</head>
        <description>
            This is the size of the mailbox being available for this user.
            E-mails which are bigger than the remaining disk space are not being saved.
            The sender receives thereby an according error notification.
            The here configured quota can be lower, however not higher that the setting
            on site-level. A site admin can assign his users thus only quota up to a
            certain limit.

        <description>
            This configures how the user can receive his mails. This setting can
            be changed at any time. But users having applied directories via IMAP
            cannot access them any more if the IMAP-access is cancelled.

        <head>Relay on auth</head>
        <description>
            This option allows the user to send mails per SMTP via this server.
            But therefore, he has to authenticate himself (with the same data set
            at the mail-reception). Is the SMTP-server operated as open relay
            (every user may send mails) this option is without effect.

        <head>Relay on check</head>
        <description>
            This option allows the user to send mails per SMTP via this server.
            But therefore, he has first to receive Mails via POP or IMAP to authenticate himself (this feature
            is also known as SMTP-after-POP or SMTP-after-IMAP). Is the SMTP-server operated as open relay
            (every user may send mails) this option is without effect.
