    <information>
        An Administrator can take up changes on all data without
        any limitations. He has total access to every function of XAMS and thus
        can administrate all Resellers and where required even whose Customers.

        <description>
            This is the Name of the Administrator as it is e.g. shown
            in the Event-Log. At login this name has to be prefixed by
            "adm_", so that XAMS knows wich kind of user it has to
            validate.

            Using this option, an Administrator can lock other
            Administrators. Thereby he can't login the XAMS
            GUI anymore.
