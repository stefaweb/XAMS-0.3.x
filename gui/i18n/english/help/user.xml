    <information>
        The user is simply expressed by the portion of an e-mail address before
        the @ symbol. Presently, a "user" in XAMS represents nothing more than an
        e-mail account.
        A user who wants to send and/or receive e-mail via a mail client (MUA) has to
        specify the entire e-mail address for the login/username.
        It should be noted that a user has as many e-mail addresses as domains
        contained in the respective site. (For example: the site "firm_name" contains
        the domains "firm_name.com" and "firm_name.net" as well as user "foo" and
        "bar". Both of the users have thereby two e-mail accounts: "foo@firm_name.com",
        "foo@firm_name.net" as well as "bar@firm_name.com" and "bar@firm_name.net".)

    <section>
        <head>Site</head>
        <description>
            This section is used to designate which site the new user should belong to.
            While the user gets a "virtual" e-mail address for every domain contained
            in this site, they only have a single "real" mailbox.

    <section>
        <head>Account name (E-Mail)</head>
        <description>
            This is the E-Mail address for the user, representing the portion of the e-mail
            address before the domain.

        <head>Unique Login name (optional)</head>
        <description>
            Optionally, you may define a "Unique Login name" with which a user can use to
            authenticate themselves (instead of using the complete e-mail address).
            This feature is useful for administrators that have to migrate from
            another mail server system and do not want to require all the users
            to update their client configurations. This feature is only recommended for
            those who fall in this latter category.

    <section>
        <head>Password</head>
        <description>
            With this password the user can log in to receive and send messages.
            Also, the user can - if permitted by the XAMS configuration - change his
            or her password after logging in to the XAMS system.

    <section>
        <head>Quota</head>
        <description>
            This is the amount of disk space a user's mailbox is allowed to store.
            Messages that would cause a mailbox to exceed this quota will be discarded,
            with the original sender receiving an appropriate error notification.
            The user-level quota can be lower -- but not higher -- than the site-level
            setting. A site admin cannot allocate more disk space to users than the site's
            quota allows.
        </description>

    <section>
        <head>Type</head>
        <description>
            This configures which protocols users can use to receive messages. This
            setting can be changed at any time. If IMAP access is granted but later
            withdrawn, any server-side mail boxes will be removed and no longer accessible
            by the previous owners.

        <head>Virus check (Incoming / Outgoing)</head>
        <description>
            With this option you can indicated whether both incoming and outgoing
            messages for this user should be checked for viruses (by an external program).

        <head>Spam check (Incoming / Outgoing)</head>
        <description>
            With this option you can indicated whether both incoming and outgoing
            messages for this user should be checked for spam (by an external program).

        <head>Relay on auth</head>
        <description>
            This option allows the user to send messages over SMTP via this server,
            provided the user authenticates with the same username and password used
            for receiving mail. If the SMTP server is operated as an open relay (i.e., no
            authentication required and anyone can send mail through the server) this
            option is ignored.
        </description>

    <section>
        <head>Relay on check</head>
        <description>
            This option allows the user to send messages over SMTP via this server,
            provided the user first receives messages via authenticated POP or IMAP.
            This feature is also known as "check before send," "SMTP-after-POP," and
            "SMTP-after-IMAP." If the SMTP server is operated as an open relay (i.e., no
            authentication required and anyone can send mail through the server) this
            option is ignored.

        <head>Status</head>
        <description>
            This function provides information about the user's status. Active refers to
            normal user privileges without limitations. Locked means a user can no longer
            retrieve any e-mail messages (neither via POP nor IMAP), although messages
            addressed to this user will still be saved and stored (provided there is
            sufficient disk space remaining in the user's quota). Locked &amp; Bounce
            takes this a step further: in this case the mail server will pretend that the
            user does not exist and will generate a bounce-message for the original sender
            indicating that the user is not reachable.
