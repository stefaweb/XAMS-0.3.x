    <information>
        Templates are a very powerful feature of XAMS, they help Users
        adding new accounts with individually saved templates.
        Most email-addresses or Sites are created with a similar scheme.
        If you know that this will be the case, then you can create a template
        in advance to speed up the task of account-creation. It is important that
        every user (no matter if admin, reseller or customer) has his own template -
        using templates from other users is impossible.
