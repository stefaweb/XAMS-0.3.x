    <information>
        The Log Overview respectively the XAMS Logging-System is controlled by the config.php.
        It is up to the System-Administrator if he wants XAMS to log several actions or not.
        For a company e.g. with a team of GlobalAdmins and dozens of SiteAdmins it is probably a
        good thing to know what the others are doing.
        This feature is only accessible by a GlobalAdmin.
