XAMS TODO
---------

Here are the current TODO list for XAMS.

XAMS GUI
--------

- Database:

  A new option to have a count report of mail accounts per Admin, Reseller, Customers, 
  and site. Global total per section. Option: CSV export

- XAMS logs: Add user connection IP in the logs.

MAILSCANNER 
-----------

- Mailscanner and SQLSpamSettingsXAMS.pm:

  SQLSpamSettingsXAMS permit to define alias to NoScan but currently the system do not manage multiple alias and "external alias".

  This doesn't work.
  -------------------

  SELECT      DISTINCT( LOWER( CONCAT( a.leftpart, '\@', d.name ) )) AS Username, 
              a.rightpart AS U_rightpart,
              s.spamcheckin AS S_spamchecking,
              u.spamcheckin AS U_spamcheckin, 
              u.name AS U_name
  FROM        pm_sites AS s
  INNER JOIN  pm_domains d
  ON          s.id = d.siteid
  INNER JOIN  pm_users u
  ON          s.id = u.siteid
  INNER JOIN  pm_aliases a
  ON          s.id = a.siteid
  WHERE       a.rightpart = u.name
  AND         s.sitestate != 'lockedbounce'
  AND         u.spamcheckin  = 'false' OR (s.spamcheckin  = 'false' AND u.spamcheckin = 'false')
  AND         u.$aliases  = 'false' OR (s.$aliases  = 'false' AND u.$aliases = 'false')
