How to update XAMS from a previous version?

- Edit autogen.conf (defaults were constants in <= 0.0.14)
- Run autogen.sh
- You may want to execute 'touch /your-xams-gui-dir/maintenance' and XAMS
  will show a maintenance-message instead of the login-screen. But don't
  forget to delete the file after updating :-)
- Apply the database-updates from updates/ if needed
- Copy over all the gui/* files to your webserver/xams root
- Copy over all the config/exim4 files to your exim-conf directory
  (be careful not to overwrite your database-settings and other custom
  configuration in exim-custom.conf)
- Copy over scripts/* to the specific directories
- Reload exim
- Restart authdaemon

That's it.
